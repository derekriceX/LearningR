## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
data()


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
table1
# compute rate per 10,000

new_data <- table1 %>% dplyr::mutate(rate = cases/population*10000)
table1 <-cbind(table1,new_data)
table1 <- table1[,-1]
table1



```


The second step is to resolve one of two common problems:

One variable might be spread across multiple columns.

One observation might be scattered across multiple rows.

Typically a dataset will only suffer from one of these problems; it’ll only suffer from both if you’re really unlucky! To fix these problems, 

you’ll need the two most important functions in tidyr: pivot_longer() and pivot_wider().

```{r}
table4a #want to put year in a single column with cases in the adjacent column
tidy4a <- table4a %>% pivot_longer(c('1999','2000'),names_to = "year",values_to="cases")
tidy4b <- table4b %>% pivot_longer(c('1999','2000'),names_to ="year", values_to="population")
my_data <- left_join(tidy4a,tidy4b)
my_data
```
```{r}
table2
tidy2 <- table2 %>% pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)
tidy2

```

```{r}
# 12.4 Separating and uniting 
table3 # two values in a single column separated by /
tidy3 <- table3 %>% separate(rate,into=c("cases","population"),sep ="/",convert=TRUE) # adding convert to go from char to int

tidy3
t3b <- tidy3 %>% separate (year,into=c("centry","year"),sep=2)
t3b
t3c <- t3b %>% unite(new,centry,year,sep="")
t3c


```

```{r}

```
