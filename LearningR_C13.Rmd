C13 - Relational Data

----

many tables of data to combine into a single table 

To work with relational data you need verbs that work with pairs of tables. There are three families of verbs designed towork with relational data:

Mutating joins - add new variables to one data frame from matching 

Filtering joins - filter obs from one data fream based on whether or not they match an obs in the other table

Set operations - which treat obs as if they were set elements

13.1.1 Prerequisites 

We will explore relational data from nyflights13 using the two table verbs from dplyr 


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

### 5 tables 

airlines
airports
planes
weather 
flights


planes %>% count(tailnum) %>% filter(n>1)

weather %>% count(year, month, day, hour) %>% filter(n>1)

```

13.3 keys

there are two types of keys that uniquely identifies an obs 

primary key - uniquely identifies an obs in its own table 

foreign key - uniquely identifies an obs in another table 

```{r}
## mutating joining - allows you to combine variables from two tables 
## matches obs by their keys and then copies across from one table to another 

flights

flights2 <- flights %>% select(year:day,hour,origin,dest,tailnum,carrier)
flights2
# view(flights2) - prints entire table out to another window 

# to add airline name to flights2 table
# link airline table using carrier key 

flight3 <- flights2 %>% select(-origin,-dest,) %>% left_join(airlines, by="carrier")

```
